# Hello World!

Every journey starts with a single step.
1. Upload the scene in my-first-game.
2. Created my-first-script with a rotating 2D object. The script rotates the icon around, and the rotation is independent to the frametrate.

3. TAKE CONTROL! Added left-right arrow for directional controls and up arrow for forward movement.
