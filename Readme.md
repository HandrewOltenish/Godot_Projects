# Hello World!

Every journey starts with a single step.
1. Upload the scene in my-first-game.
2. Created my-first-script with a rotating 2D object. The script rotates the icon around, and the rotation is independent to the frametrate.

3. TAKE CONTROL! Added left-right arrow for directional controls and up arrow for forward movement.

4. [Distant signals.](https://youtu.be/9fl58muc7SE?si=T0CmOZRPSwnf5zuD) Added a button sending a signal that turns the icon's visibility property on and off. (and lowered GIF resolution from 800x600 to 640x480)

5. Created my-first-2d-game: implementing character sprites, animations, collissions.
6. Created mobs and set game rules such as game-over upon hit, time-based score system. The system is WIP, but the game runs!

7. Implemented HUD with cool text.

**8. Completed my first 2D game project!** I added background color, sound effects, and linked everything together.

9. Created the 3D project "Squash the Creeps 3D". Look at that crispy lighting!

10. Created collision sphere for the player body, and mapped the keys for controlling the player.

11. Gave directional movement to the Player. 8 whole directions. So many options!

12. Designed the mobs with random spawnng points, speeds, and going towards the player at a random angle. Can't wait to spawn them!

13. Added mob spawn script. Now they spawn at a a random interval on a pre-determined path. Currently they boop and stack in the scene.

14. Modified the ground, mob, and player physical intercations (layers + masks) so mobs don't collide with each other. Vroom!

15. Worked on collisions and squash mechanic. Now the player squashes the mob it's over the mob at about 90 degree angle

16. Improved object collision, mobs only change x and z directions, and now player dies when is on the floor and colliding directly with mobs

**17. Completed my first 3D Project! Added UI, player and mob animations, scaled the speed when they are moving, fixed jumping and falling velocity.**

18. Uploaded Treearock Game Design Document.
19. Learning GDScript from Zero. Completed Lesson 1 to 3. Learned about the proper way to call functions, parameters, radians, and coordinates.
